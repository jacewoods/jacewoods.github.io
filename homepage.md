## Welcome

Hello, my name is Jace Woods! I am a Computer Science student at Western Oregon University intended to graduate in July 2019. This page exists as a portfolio for my senior project. In here you will find links to some of the programming I did over the course of the 2018-19 school year, as well as some information on the processes taken to build these projects!
