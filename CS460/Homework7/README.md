The seventh assignment in CS460 involves working with APIs. The Giphy API to be specific. To utilize the API within our MVC Web Application, we use Javascript and JSON to gather the required information and AJAX for responsive, quick results. The Giphy API itself is a "translater" that essentially takes the user input and, if it isn't a generic word like "to" or "she", will convert the word into a image relevant to the input, via the JSON that is returned using the Giphy API.
