The first homework assignment of CS460 was based on getting acquainted with a few things:
1. Git
1. GitHub
1. HTML
1. CSS
1. Bootstrap

I had a decent enough knowledge of how all of the languages and software listed above worked, with bootstrap being the 
exception. Due to this, bootstrap gave me the biggest hurdle to pass in order to get my site up and running how I wanted it to, with
the other listed items being more of a refresher/review.
