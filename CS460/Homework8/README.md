Assignment #8 involved using the skills we've learned over the past few weeks and wrapping it all up in a multi-page, multi-table relational database web application that also uses javascript and AJAX. Below you'll find an E-R Diagram demonstrating the relationships of the tables built into the website, as well as a video demoing the site in action!
