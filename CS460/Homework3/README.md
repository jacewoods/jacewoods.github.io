The third assignment in CS460 included learning how to use the following things:
1. Visual Studio
1. C#
1. Merging branches with Git

# Visual Studio
The first thing to do to get a C# environment running was to download [Visual Studio IDE](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), specifically, the 2017 Community version. I've been using this specific version of Visual Studio for a few months now as my main code editor, so getting used to some of it's basic features like auto formatting (Ctrl+K+D) was not a problem. I have not used it to run C# code, however, so learning how to do this was the first step in my process for the homework.

The main thing that initially tripped me up with Visual Studio and C# was how code was ran and executed. When I built a simple 'Hello World' program, it did not appear to run when I clicked the green play button. However, running it with the debugger (Ctrl+F5) fixed this issue, and I stuck with this method of running code during my tests when the actual java converted program was complete.

# C#
Converting the java code to C# code was a somewhat complicated but satisfying experience. I haven't worked with java much in the past as I first learned how to code primarily in C++. That said, I was surprised how much more similar C# was to java than to C++, which logically should make more sense. The code conversions were mostly 1-to-1, but there were a few errors that I found and had to do some research to discover the error and resolve the difference in syntax.
