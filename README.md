## Welcome
Hello, my name is Jace Woods! I am recent graduate at Western Oregon University (June 2019), earning a B.S. in Computer Science and Magna Cum Laude Honors. This page exists as a portfolio for the work I did during my senior year. I have Full-Stack Web and Mobile development experience (primarily working with ASP.Net and its tools), as well as experience using tools related to Data Entry/Databases, Security, and Microservices. I enjoy advancing my knowledge with the tools I have experience with, and love learning and teaching myself new languages/frameworks as well! I am currently open to any job opportunities relevant to Software Engineering, with a particular interest of Web and Mobile Development and Data Entry!
